On an Anaconda Prompt terminal:
> pip install flask
> pip install pyserial

Check the COM port (if you are using windows) where the Arduino is connected (for example, COM8), and modify app.py accordingly: 
SERIAL_PORT = 'COM8'  # Windows - Replace with the actual port for your Arduino

Then navigate to the folder containing app.py:
> python app.py

If everything works well, the program should output the IP address on the terminal:
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

If you get some errors of missing packages, look for the name of the package and run the appropriate "pip install ...".

Open a new browser tab and paste the ip and port: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the one printed in your terminal)

Set the fan array size (6x6) and run. In the terminal you should see the messages sent to the Arduino board.
